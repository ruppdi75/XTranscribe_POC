# **App Name**: XTranscribe Enhanced

## Core Features:

- UI Modernization: Modernize the UI using ShadCN/UI components for a cleaner and more consistent look, replacing standard Bootstrap elements where appropriate.
- Smart Prompt Suggestions: Implement a smart prompt suggestion tool for the summarization feature. The tool analyzes the transcript content and suggests relevant prompts to guide the summarization, enhancing the output's relevance and quality.
- Configurable Display Settings: Add a basic settings panel where users can configure the display, such as the font size in the transcript editor.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a vibrant teal (#008080) to highlight interactive elements and provide a modern feel.
- Ensure responsive layouts using CSS grid and flexbox for adaptability across various screen sizes, maintaining the existing structure but optimizing for smaller devices.
- Maintain the use of Bootstrap icons for consistency, but explore options for custom icons to represent unique actions or integrations.
